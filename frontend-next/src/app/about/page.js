          Our Story
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          LaTeX Writer was founded in 2025 with the vision of making LaTeX
          editing simpler and more accessible for everyone. The idea was born
          when I was working on my final presentation in LaTeX and realized the
          process felt unnecessarily complex and time-consuming. Determined to
          find a better way, I immersed myself in learning LaTeX and exploring
          how its editing experience could be improved. What started as a
          personal challenge quickly grew into a mission — to build a platform
          that makes LaTeX editing faster, smoother, and user-friendly for
          students, researchers, and professionals alike.{" "}
